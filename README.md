## Rules & Guidelines
Here in Starlight World, safety is the most important entity. It is taken seriously and anyone breaking any of these rules will be punished, whether by a warning or by a temporary or permenant ban.

### Moderator Commands
Once you purchase the Moderation Tools gamepass, the controls are yours. However, this means a high responsibility to use them wisely. Abuse of these tools will result in a permenant ban.

### NSFW Behavior / Content
Roblox has made it clear that they will take down any game if it is filled with players participating in NSFW activity. Such activities are prohibited from Starlight World, and those who are caught doing so will face a permenant ban from Starlight World with no appeal.

### Exploiting & Hacking
Players are not allowed to cheat, hack, or otherwise exploit any minigame in Starlight World to their advantage. If you are suspected to have been cheating, hacking, or exploiting the game in any way, you will not be allowed to play any of these minigames.

## How to Change Your Appearance
Starlight World has a special feature for letting you change your outfit. However, custom avatar appearance usage is not fully implemented. You can change your look by entering one of the closets in the bedroom where you start off. There, you can modify your appearance in order to change your look, by changing into a bodysuit, PJs, a costume, or even a casual outfit. If your preferred outfit isn't shown here, you can request it via Discord.

## How to Spawn an AI
At the moment, you can only spawn your clone bot with specific animations which are available to you, and only in certain areas within Starlight World. You can do this, however, by clicking on the yellow and blue doodle on the top center of the screen.

## How to teleport to a designated Portal
There are warp stations placed throughout Starlight World's main area. You can warp to any of these portals by clicking Teleport (located on the top right corner). Use the drag wheel on the right hand side to pan the screen, and your mouse wheel to zoom in or out. Currently, there is no support for the Gamepad.
